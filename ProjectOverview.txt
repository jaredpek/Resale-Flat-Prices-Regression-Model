Project Description:
- Build a Machine Learning Model to predict the price of a Resale Flat in Singapore.
- Model will use data of the attributes of a Resale Flat to predict its Resale Price.

Project Approach:
1. Problem Definition:
    - Given a flat's attributes and details, predict the Resale Price of the Flat

2. Data Details:
    - Resale Flat Dataset Description:
        - Original Data from https://data.gov.sg/dataset/resale-flat-prices
        - Time Period is from Jan 2017 to Apr 2022 only
    - Patterns between Columns in the Dataset:
        - Relationship between Town and Resale Price
        - Relationship between Flat Type and Resale Price
        - Relationship between Storey Range and Resale Price
        - Relationship between Flat Model and Resale Price
        - Relationship beween Floor Area and Resale Price
        - Flat Prices over Time from 2017 to 2022

3. Data Features:
    - Flat Prices Data Attributes:
        - month (Date the flat was sold in YYYY-MM-DD)
        - town (Name of the Town where the flat was located)
        - flat_type (Type of flat)
        - block (Number of the Block where the flat was located)
        - street_name (Name of the street where the flat was located)
        - storey_range (Range of Levels where the flat was on)
        - floor_area_sqm (Floor Area of the flat in sqm)
        - flat_model (Model of the Flat)
        - lease_commence_date (Start Date of the Lease in YYYY-MM-DD)
        - remaining_lease (Remaining Lease of the flat in Years)
        - resale_price (Resale Price of the flat in SGD)

4. Evaluation Metrics Goal:
    - Model should achieve an R2 Score of at least 0.75 in predicting Flat Prices.

5. Modelling:
    - Data Analysis and Manipulation:
        - Pandas
        - Matplotlib
    -Scikit-Learn Models:
        - RandomForestRegressor
        - DecisionTreeRegressor
    - Model Evaluation:
        - Mean Absolute Error
        - Median Absolute Error
        - Root Mean Squared Error
        - Mean Absolute Percentage Error
        - Mean Squared Log Error
        - R2 Score
    - Model Tuning and Improvement:
        - GridSearchCV
